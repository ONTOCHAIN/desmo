# Use case
![DESMO-LD](imgs/desmo-logo.png)

This section is described a complete use case and the relative components usage.
We will refer to the Decentralized EV sharing (DEVs), presented in the introduction of that documentation [DEVs](./instro.md# Feasible scenarios of a use case).

Summary of DEVs.
A platform for electric vehicle sharing. A provider of cars, scooters, and bikes, can register their vehicles and the users can get and use them.
/*
    ########WIP: 
    here we need a better explanation of the action that the providers and the users should do
*/

We start with a bottom-up approach by looking at the components.
We will configure our TDs in order to map an electric vehicle, the Directories that can represent a provider of the vehicle, or one of the provider's offices.
Finally, we will configure the DESMO-LD components.

# TDs
/*
    ########WIP: 
    here we need the TDs description
    like:
    all the properties that can be read and all the properties that will do an action (like "take the vehicle)
*/

# Directories

# DESMO-LD DApp

# DESMO-LD Contract

# DESMO-LD frontend

# Let's try our system
