# Thing Description Directory
![DESMO-LD](../imgs/desmo-logo.png)

In the context of the W3C Web of Things, Thing Description Directories are services that store a set of Thing Descriptions. A TDD offers a set of APIs with CRUD operation on the collection of TDs that it stores. In DESMO-LD TDDs play a crucial role as they are the main search engine for IoT devices outside the chain. To promote a fair and distributed ecosystem VAIMEE will not host a centralized TDDs where TDs are stored in some remote facility, on the contrary, leveraging on the Desmo-LD HUB and Desmo-LD iExecDOracle it will promote an open search engine and repository for Thing Descriptions. Device owners or third parties may deploy their own TDDs with their own access policies and join the distributed network of Desmo-LD. The requirements for joining the network are:
Having a W3C compliant API
Registering in the Desmo-LD hub
Optionally, support Desmo-LD advanced discovery APIs for geolocation based queries.
