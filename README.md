The DESMO-LD project aims to provide a fully integrated distributed solution for consuming IoT external data, enriched with Web of Things semantics and data model, inside the ONTOCHAIN. This addresses the ONTOCHAIN call's objectives of designing new trustful decentralized Oracles to poll semantic data from off-chain data sources. Besides, DESMO-LD introduces novel strategies to solve the known interoperability problems thanks to the heavy deployment of standard ontology and semantic oriented consensus algorithms for data quality and trustiness.

# Architecture
The system architecture is divided between an on-chain part, consisting of a set of smart contracts, and an off-chain part with the Oracle DApp and the Web of Things Thing Description Directory (TDD). The project structure is consequently organized as follows:
- [Smart Contracts](./desmo-contracts/README.md)
- [Oracle DApp](./oracle-dapp.md)
- [TDD](./tdd.md)

For an overview of the system architecture, please refer to the [architecture diagram](./imgs/architecture.jpg).
