**Overview**
> The DESMO-LD project aims to provide a fully integrated distributed solution for consuming IoT external data, enriched with Web of Things semantics and data model, inside the ONTOCHAIN. This addresses the ONTOCHAIN call's objectives of designing new trustful decentralized Oracles to poll semantic data from off-chain data sources. Besides, DESMO-LD introduces novel strategies to solve the known interoperability problems thanks to the heavy deployment of standard ontology and semantic oriented consensus algorithms for data quality and trustiness.

## Architecture
DESMO-LD is a Decentralized Oracle for IoT data powered by WoT technologies. The system architecture is divided between an on-chain part, consisting of a set of smart contracts, and an off-chain part with the Oracle DApp and the Web of Things Thing Description Directory (TDD). The project structure is consequently organized as follows:
- [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/vaimee/desmo-contracts/blob/55cf7b0dec88ca211250b0a95a67a6bcffad89ee/README.md)
- [Oracle DApp](https://github.com/vaimee/desmo-dapp/blob/bea690443eb16dbc563f6c0c5d3f391d8587038a/README.md)
- [TDD](https://github.com/vaimee/zion/blob/6299f56bb0975a4d3eed372a5cc463e2ae51477f/README.md)

For an overview of the system architecture, please refer to the [architecture diagram](./imgs/architecture.jpg).

The system allows client Smart Contracts and DApps to access off-chain data produced by a network of IoT devices. The solution enables the development of different applications according to the vertical implementation of any horizontal features developed. The value generated by the token transactions is enhanced through the development of a “pay-per-request” subscription service to access the resources. Throughout the process to retrieve information all the actors involved will be rewarded with tokens.


**On-Chain: Decentralized iExecDoracle**

The on-chain part is strictly connected to the development of a decentralized network of Oracles. The value of the Decentralized Oracle lies in the trustfulness of the data provided on-chain which increases the level of security and fairness of Smart Contracts. Data and process management in cross-sectors environments mostly benefit from a Smart Contract built upon Decentralized Oracles because they can enhance the intrinsic value of getting access to multiple and heterogeneous data sources that are reliable.

**Off-Chain: WoT Decentralized Data Sources**

The off-chain part is linked to the [Web of Thing]( https://www.w3.org/WoT/) functionality and technologies. Value is created by accessing a constant real-time stream of quality IoT data from the WoT. Moreover, it features a ranking system able to assess data sources' quality to de-incentives bad or unfair behaviour. Data streamed are organized and defined in [Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-wot-thing-description-20200409/) which manifest the interactions affordances among IoT devices or services. The generated value is enhanced through the automatic rewarding of the possessors of WTs devices that the architecture guarantee.

## Main Innovation
The DESMO-LD project will focus on a trusted decentralized oracle system to reliably
consume IoT data from on-chain Smart Contracts. The main innovation points consists:
- Leverage on [WoT interaction model](https://www.w3.org/TR/2020/REC-wot-architecture-20200409/) and [WoT ontology](https://www.w3.org/2019/wot/td) for implementing an
interoperable connection layer with heterogeneous IoT systems and devices;
- Provide trustable means to induce real world effects thanks to attenuation APIs;
- Native support for geolocation queries and data.

## Deployment

To deploy the DESMO-LD system, start by cloning the repository:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vaimee/desmo
```

After the command you should see all the repositories on your local Desmo folder.
Notice, as git submodule works, all the cloned repositories will be not at their latest
main branch commit. We are manually update git submodule references to keep
everything updated, but in case you need to fetch the latest commit, follow the next
procedure:

```bash
cd ${submodule_folder}
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull
```

Remember to do that procedure for each Desmo module. At this point you should have all the latest changes on your local machine. We can now proceed with the deployment.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js 16+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm 7+](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Deploying the Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are deployed using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) framework. To deploy the contracts, run the following commands:

```bash
cd desmo-contracts
npm ci
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

After the last command, you should see the new contract addresses printed on the console. Those addresses are also saved in the `desmo-contracts/deployed.json` file. You can use those addresses to configure the other components of the system. Now you can register the minimum number of Thing Description Directories required to start the system. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy:init
```

Currently, the script register 4 TDDs that are managed by VAIMEE. You can change this behavior by modifying the `desmo-contracts/hardhat.config.ts` file (check the `RegisterTDDs` hardhat script). Now the contracts are ready to be used. To integrate them into the other system components it is useful to published them as a npm package. Before doing so you have to change the name of the package inside the `package.json`. Use your npm handle and set the `name` property to `@<yournpmuser>/desmo-contracts`. Then you can publish it to npm:

```bash
npm run publish --access public
```

You can start deploying the other components of the system, but before that you have to configure the SDK to use the deployed contracts.

### Deploying the Desmo SDK

The Desmo SDK is a TypeScript library that allows you to interact with the deployed smart contracts and the DApp. To deploy and configure the SDK, run the following commands:

```bash
cd desmo-sdk
npm ci
```

Now you have to configure the SDK to use the deployed contracts. It is pretty simple, just uninstall the `@vaimee/desmo-contracts` package and install the one you just published:

```bash
npm un @vaimee/desmo-contracts
npm i @<yournpmuser>/desmo-contracts
```

To use your own contracts, you have also to update all the imports in the `desmo-sdk/src` folder. Look for the `@vaimee/desmo-contracts` package imports and replace it with `@<yournpmuser>/desmo-contracts`. Now you can build the SDK:
```bash
npm run build
```

The SDK is now ready to be used. You can publish it to npm as well:
1. Rename the package inside the `package.json` file, use your npm handle and set the `name` property to `@<yournpmuser>/desmo-sdk`.
2. Publish it to npm: `npm run publish --access public`

### Deploying the DApp

The DApp is a IExec applications that interact with the smart contracts and the Thing Description Directories. [DApp readme](./desmo-dapp/README.md) contains some deployment information too, but refer to this guide to have a complete overview of the deployment process. To start deploying the DApp, run the following commands:

```bash
cd desmo-dapp/DApp
npm ci
```

Now install the Desmo SDK you have just published:
```bash
npm un @vaimee/desmo-sdk
npm i @<yournpmuser>/desmo-sdk
```

Don't forget to update the imports in the `desmo-dapp/DApp/src` folder. Simply look for the `@vaimee/desmo-sdk` package imports and replace it with `@<yournpmuser>/desmo-sdk`. Now you can verify if the imports are correct by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

After you [set up your wallet](./desmo-dapp/DApp#Setting_your_wallet), you can deploy the DApp to the Iexec marketplace. To do so start from building and publish the docker image of the DApp:

```bash
npm run docker_build

# replace <your_docker_username> with your docker username
docker tag desmo-dapp <your_docker_username>/desmo-dapp:<version>
# push the image to docker hub
docker push <your_docker_username>/desmo-dapp:<version>
```

Copy the checksum of the docker image in the file `iexec.json` under `app.checksumm`.
Check the `app.multiaddr` and `app.owner`  of the same file, they need to corrispond to the URL of your docker hum image and your wallet address respectively. Now you can deploy the DApp to the Iexec marketplace:

```bash
npm run onchain_deploy

# Set up the order of the DApp
npx iexec order init --app
npx iexec order sign --app
npx iexec order publish --app
```

Now the DApp is ready to be used. *Note* the [deployed.json](./desmo-dapp/DApp/deployed.json) file contains the DApp address. You can use this address to configure the other components of the system. Finally, you have to deploy the frontend.

### Deploying the Desmo Frontend

The Desmo frontend is a Angular application that allows you to interact with the DApp, the contracts and the Thing Description Directory. To deploy the frontend, start with the following commands:

```bash
cd desmo-frontend
npm ci
```

Now you have to configure the frontend to use the deployed DApp and contracts. To do so, open the `desmo-frontend/src/environments/environment.ts` file and set the `iExecDAppAddress` property to the address of the DApp you have just deployed. Moreover, install the Desmo SDK you have published in the previous steps:

```bash
npm un @vaimee/desmo-sdk
npm i @<yournpmuser>/desmo-sdk
```

Don't forget to update the imports in the `desmo-dapp/DApp/src` folder. Simply look for the `@vaimee/desmo-sdk` package imports and replace it with `@<yournpmuser>/desmo-sdk`. Now you can verify if the imports are correct by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If everything is correct, you can deploy the frontend to a web server. You can use the following command to start a local web server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The frontend is now ready, you can head to https://localhost:4200 to use it.
